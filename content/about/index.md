# About me

![Headshot](headshot.png)

I am an electrical engineer who is interested in traveling, biking, hiking, electronics, programming, and computers. This is my personal blog where I will be writing about things that I am learning or interested right now. This blog will continue to evolve over time as I continue to learn.

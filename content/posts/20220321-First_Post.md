## Welcome

I am restarting my blog with two goals. The first one is to give me a digital presence in which to communicate to the digital world. The second is to help keep track of my goals somewhere. I have been writing to markdown files privately, but I wanted to start doing this publicly since most of the information might be helpful to others and not need to be kept secure. This is mainly meant for my personal thought on a wide variety of topics. I will be tagging each post and you can check out my tag tab above to see what I have written about. Starting out, I will probably be writing about the following:

## Topics

- Computers
  - Home Servers
  - Open Media Vault
  - Home Networks
  - Macs
  - Wordpress
- Maker
  - 3D Printer
  - Blender
  - Home Remodel
- Programming
  - VS Code
  - Command Line Interface
- Crypto Currencies
  - Bitcoin
  - Ethereum
- Photography
  - Lightroom / Photoshop
- Travel
  - Hiking / Backpacking
  - Biking
  - Exploring

These are some of my interests. I may cover some topics more than others. These topics may change. This blog is starting off as a place for me to write personally which may change in time. Thanks for reading and welcome to my blog.

## Setting up Hugo

After 8 months, I am back posting on my website. Hopefully more will follow. I will be updating this post over the coming days to document my current setup for this website. I am using hugo install with homebrew on a mac.

## Links

I am using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/macos/) on the mac with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing command line programs. Follow the link to install homebrew before starting. I am using the [LoveIt](https://hugoloveit.com/) theme for my site. The repository fo this theme is [here](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt).

## Installing

To install hugo on the mac, use the following commands

```bash
brew install hugo
```
